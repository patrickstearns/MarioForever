# MarioForever

I made a Mario Maker even before it was cool!  This is a fully functional (if slightly janky) Mario game written in Java.  It totally works, start to finish, with original levels n' such.

Much of the original base engine was adapted from a project called Infinite Mario that I can't find the link to any longer, but it looks like several versions of it or something like it are on google.
